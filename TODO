- Option for pure Haskell 98 output?
	- maybe Haskell 2010 at this point?
	- how about an option to use Data.Array.Unboxed?

- Put in {-# LINE #-} pragmas for token actions

- Prune states that aren't reachable?

- Issue a warning for tokens that can't be generated?

- Info file?
	- start codes
	- accepting states

- More compact lexer table encoding:
	- equivalence classes?

- Improve performance of Alex itself

- AlexEOF doesn't provide a way to get at the text position of the EOF.

- Allow user-defined wrappers?  Wrappers in files relative to the
  current directory, for example?

- case-insensitivity option (like flex's -i).
