## Unreleased

 * No longer include pre-generated Parser.hs in the Hackage upload, as
   Happy's new ability to bootstrap from parser combinators is a better
   way to make building easy and less trustful.

 * Allow arbitary repetitions in regexps.
   Previously, the `r{n,m}` and related forms were restricted to single
   digit numbers `n` and `m`.

 * DFA minimization used to crash on tokens of the form `c*` which
   produce automata with only accepting states.  Considering the empty
   set of non-accepting states as an equivalence class caused
   minimization to crash with exception.

 * The `small_base` flag is removed.  Extremely old GHCs will no longer
   build.

 * A number of bug fixes and clearer diagnostics.

## Changes in 3.2.6:

 * Support for the GHC 9.2.

   The array access primops now use the fixed-sized numeric types
   corresponding to the width of the data accessed. Additionally, the
   primops to convert to and from fixed-sized numeric types have been
   given new names.

   9.2 isn't cut yet, so these changes are somewhat speculative.
   Unfortunately, GHC must used a released version of Alex (and Happy)
   at all times until further changes have been made, so we must make
   the release to actually implement these changes in GHC.

   If the final GHC 9.2 ends up being different, this release will be
   marked broken to make it less likely people use it by accident.

## Changes in 3.2.5:

 * Build fixes for GHC 8.8.x

## Changes in 3.2.4:

 * Remove dependency on QuickCheck
 * Change the way that bootstrapping is done: see README.md for build
   instructions

## Changes in 3.2.3:

 * fix issue when using cpphs (#116)

## Changes in 3.2.2:

 * Manage line length in generated files [GH-84]
 * Fix issue when identifier with multiple single quotes, e.g. `foo''` was used
 * Allow omitting spaces around `=` in macro definitions
 * Include pre-generated Parser.hs and Scan.hs in the Hackage upload, to
   make bootstrapping easier.

## Changes in 3.2.1:

 * Fix build problem with GHC; add new test tokens_scan_user.x

## Changes in 3.2.0:

 * Allow the token type and productions to be overloaded, and add new
   directives: %token, %typeclass, %action.  See "Type Signatures and
   Typeclasses" in the manual.
 * Some small space leak fixes

##  Changes in 3.1.7:

 * Add support for `%encoding` directive
   (allows to control `--latin1` from inside Alex scripts)
 * Make code forward-compatible with in-progress proposals
 * Suppress more warnings

##  Changes in 3.1.6:

 * `sdist` for 3.1.5 was mis-generated, causing it to ask for Happy
    when building.

## Changes in 3.1.5:

 * Generate less warning-laden code, and suppress other warnings.
 * Bug fixes.

##  Changes in 3.1.4:

 * Add Applicative/Functor instances for GHC 7.10

##  Changes in 3.1.3:

 * Fix for clang (XCode 5)

##  Changes in 3.1.2:

 * Add missing file to extra-source-files

##  Changes in 3.1.1:

 * Bug fixes (#24, #30, #31, #32)

##  Changes in 3.1.0:

 * necessary changes to work with GHC 7.8.1

##  Changes in 3.0 (since 2.3.5)

 * Unicode support (contributed mostly by Jean-Philippe Bernardy,
   with help from Alan Zimmerman).

   * An Alex lexer now takes a UTF-8 encoded byte sequence as input
     (see Section 5.1, “Unicode and UTF-8”. If you are using the
     "basic" wrapper or one of the other wrappers that takes a
     Haskell String as input, the string is automatically encoded
     into UTF-8 by Alex. If your input is a ByteString, you are
     responsible for ensuring that the input is UTF-8 encoded. The
     old 8-bit behaviour is still available via the --latin1
     option.

   * Alex source files are assumed to be in UTF-8, like Haskell
     source files. The lexer specification can use Unicode
     characters and ranges.

   * `alexGetChar` is renamed to `alexGetByte` in the generated code.

   * There is a new option, `--latin1`, that restores the old
     behaviour.

 * Alex now does DFA minimization, which helps to reduce the size
   of the generated tables, especially for lexers that use Unicode.
