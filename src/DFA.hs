{-                        Defined in the Scan Module

-- (This section should logically belong to the DFA module but it has been
-- placed here to make this module self-contained.)
--
-- `DFA' provides an alternative to `Scanner' (described in the RExp module);
-- it can be used directly to scan text efficiently.  Additionally it has an
-- extra place holder for holding action functions for generating
-- application-specific tokens.  When this place holder is not being used, the
-- unit type will be used.
--
-- Each state in the automaton consist of a list of `Accept' values, descending
-- in priority, and an array mapping characters to new states.  As the array
-- may only cover a sub-range of the characters, a default state number is
-- given in the third field.  By convention, all transitions to the -1 state
-- represent invalid transitions.
--
-- A list of accept states is provided for as the original specification may
-- have been ambiguous, in which case the highest priority token should be
-- taken (the one appearing earliest in the specification); this can not be
-- calculated when the DFA is generated in all cases as some of the tokens may
-- be associated with leading or trailing context or start codes.
--
-- `scan_token' (see above) can deal with unconditional accept states more
-- efficiently than those associated with context; to save it testing each time
-- whether the list of accept states contains an unconditional state, the flag
-- in the first field of `St' is set to true whenever the list contains an
-- unconditional state.
--
-- The `Accept' structure contains the priority of the token being accepted
-- (lower numbers => higher priorities), the name of the token, a place holder
-- that can be used for storing the `action' function for constructing the
-- token from the input text and the scanner's state, a list of start codes
-- (listing the start codes that the scanner must be in for the token to be
-- accepted; empty => no restriction), the leading and trailing context (both
-- `Nothing' if there is none).
--
-- The leading context consists simply of a character predicate that will
-- return true if the last character read is acceptable.  The trailing context
-- consists of an alternative starting state within the DFA; if this `sub-dfa'
-- turns up any accepting state when applied to the residual input then the
-- trailing context is acceptable (see `scan_token' above).

-- Scanners are converted to DFAs by converting them to NFAs first.  Converting
-- an NFA to a DFA works by identifying the states of the DFA with subsets of
-- the NFA.  The PartDFA is used to construct the DFA; it is essentially a DFA
-- in which the states are represented directly by state sets of the NFA.
-- `nfa2pdfa' constructs the partial DFA from the NFA by searching for all the
-- transitions from a given list of state sets, initially containing the start
-- state of the partial DFA, until all possible state sets have been considered
-- The final DFA is then constructed with a `mk_dfa'.

-- and ignoring it if the state is already in the partial DFA, otherwise
-- generating all possible transitions from it, adding the new state to the

-- it incorporates the trailing context references into the search (by
-- including `rctx_ss' in the search).

-- A `PartDFA' is a partially constructed DFA in which the states are

-- triple consisting of the start state of the partial DFA, the NFA from which
-- it is derived and a map from state sets to states of the partial DFA.  The
-- state set for a given list of NFA states is calculated by taking the epsilon
-- closure of all the states, sorting the result with duplicates eliminated.

-- `mk_st' constructs a state node from the list of accept values and a list of

-- unconditional entry, in which case the first field of `St' should be true,
-- and which default state to use in constructing the array (the array may span
-- a sub-range of the character set, the state number given the third argument
-- of `St' being taken as the default if an input character lies outside the
-- range).  The default values is chosen to minimise the bounds of the array
-- and so there are two candidates: the value that 0 maps to (in which case
-- some initial segment of the array may be omitted) or the value that 255 maps
-- to (in which case a final segment of the array may be omitted), hence the
-- calculation of `(df,bds)'.
