		       Alex: A Lexical Analyser Generator

Alex is a Lex-like tool for generating Haskell scanners.  For complete
documentation, see the doc directory.

   http://www.haskell.org/alex/
   http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/alex

Alex is built using Cabal.  First install GHC, then:
 
  $ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  $ runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  $ runhaskell Setup.lhs install

Alex version 2.0 has changed fairly considerably since version 1.x,
and the syntax is almost completely different.  For a detailed list of
changes, see the release notes in the documentation.

Alex is now covered by a BSD-Style licence; see the licence file in
the `doc' directory for details.

The sources are in the the `src' directory and the documentation in the `doc'
directory; various  examples are in the 'examples' subdirectory.

The source code in the 'src' and 'examples' directories is intended
for a Haskell 98 compiler with hierarchical modules.  It should work
with GHC >= 5.04.
